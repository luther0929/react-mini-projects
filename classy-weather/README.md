# 🌧️ Classy Weather - ReactJS

A weather webapp that generates the 7-day forecast of any city in the world.

Built using React outdated class components to help me learn what came before functional components, a more modern, concise, and often more intuitive way to build React applications.

## 🧠 What I learned
- Explicity lifecycles of class components vs more concise useEffect hook of functional components
- this.state and this.setState() of class components vs the modern useState() hook of functional components
- Less readability of class components compared from functional components
